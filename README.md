# ‚öôÔ∏è Chapter 07: Code Improvements & Best Practices

## üåü **Chapter Summary**
This chapter covers enhancements and refactoring made to the existing microservices to improve maintainability, security, and scalability.  
The focus is on **externalizing configuration**, **standardizing data transfer**, **handling exceptions**, and applying **best practices** in microservice development.

## üîß **Key Improvements**

### 1. **Externalized Configuration**
- Moved hard-coded values to **application properties** or **environment variables**.
- Examples of externalized properties:
  - Kafka topic names and server URLs
  - Email sender address and subject
  - Database credentials and ports

### 2. **Configuration Classes**
- Enabled type-safe access via configuration classes.
- Centralized access to configuration through dedicated classes.
- Properties are automatically mapped to Java objects.
- Improves readability and reduces hard-coded literals in services.

### 3. **Exception Handling**
- Added **custom exceptions** for:
  - Invalid input
  - Entity not found
  - Business logic violations
- Centralized exception handling for REST APIs.

### 4. **DTO Usage**
- Introduced **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** to:
  - Separate internal models from API payloads
  - Simplify validation and serialization
  - Reduce coupling between services

### 5. **Security & Environment Variables**
- Sensitive properties (e.g., database passwords, email credentials) are retrieved from **environment variables**.
- Reduces risk of exposing secrets in code repositories.

### 6. **Code Quality & Maintainability**
- Refactored services to:
  - Reduce code duplication
  - Improve readability
- Enhanced logging for better traceability in microservice communication.

## üîÑ **Benefits of These Improvements**
- Easier to maintain and extend the codebase
- Better security for sensitive data
- Clear separation of concerns
- Standardized error handling across services
- Scalable and flexible configuration for different environments
